bestSequence            Given a position weight matrix, find the best
                        matching sequence

degeneratePWM           Create a degenerate PWM i.e. for each aa group,
                        set weight to the best weight of the group at
                        that position e.g. R-2 has weight 0.7, K-2 has
                        weight 0.1. Set both R-2 and K-2 to 0.7
